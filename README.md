# Dockerizing Flask with Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx


### Development

Uses the default Flask development server.

1. Build the images and run the containers:

    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    Test it out at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). The "web" folder is mounted into the container and code changes apply automatically.

### Production

Uses gunicorn + nginx.

1. Build the images and run the containers:

    ```sh
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
    ```

    Test it out at [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337). No mounted folders. To apply changes, the image must be re-built.
